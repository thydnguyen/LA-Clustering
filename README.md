###  Code for the paper "Improved Learning-augmented Algorithms for k-means and k-medians Clustering"

## Files:

- _code_.py: Includes implementation of algorithm 1, algorithm 2 in the submission, as well as algorithm 1 and algorithm 5 in "Learning-Augmented k-means Clustering"  Ergun et al. (2022). The code is adapted from the implementation provided in https://openreview.net/forum?id=X8cLTHexYyY. 
- alpha_experiment_kmeans.py: Experiments on the k-means clustering. Includes instruction on how to run the experiments.
- alpha_experiment_kmedians.py: Experiments on the k-medians clustering. Includes instruction on how to run the experiments. 
- datasets: folder with datasets, unzip the files before running the code.
- _run_alpha_experiments.sh: run all alpha experiments in the paper.
